      <p>
        Previously working in hospitality, I took charge of a hotel and its team of
        approximately 25 employees immediately prior to the pandemic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Working hard to foster a fun, respectful and inclusive culture, the team and I achieved
        some fantastic successes despite the difficult times we faced.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using skills learned in my own time, I developed programs to assist the team in
        efficiently tackling tasks including stock ordering, compliance tracking and
        accounting.
