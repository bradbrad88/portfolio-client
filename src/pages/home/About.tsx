      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <h3>Professional</h3>
      <p>
        Previously working in hospitality, I took charge of a hotel and its team of
        approximately 25 employees immediately prior to the pandemic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Working hard to foster a fun, respectful and inclusive culture, the team and I achieved
        some fantastic successes despite the difficult times we faced.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using skills learned in my own time, I developed programs to assist the team in
        efficiently tackling tasks including stock ordering, compliance tracking and
        accounting.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <h3>Personal</h3>
      <p>Some pass-times I enjoy are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Drumming - anything unique or interesting</li>
        <li>Sports - basketball and taekwondo</li>
        <li>Games - rocket league or most rpgs</li>
        <li>Spending time with the family</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
